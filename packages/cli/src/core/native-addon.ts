/**
 * Materialize the @tursodatabase NAPI addon embedded in the compiled
 * `claude-prove` binary to a stable on-disk cache file, returning that path for
 * `NAPI_RS_NATIVE_LIBRARY_PATH`.
 *
 * Why not point the loader straight at the embedded `/$bunfs/root/…node` path:
 * `require()`-ing a `.node` out of the binary's virtual filesystem forces bun to
 * extract it to a SHARED, executable-derived temp path and then clean that path
 * up. When several `claude-prove` processes launch at once — which Claude Code
 * does on every hook batch (a single tool event fans out `cafi gate` +
 * `run-state` + `scrum` hooks simultaneously) — one process's extraction or
 * cleanup clobbers a sibling mid-load and the sibling sees no binding
 * ("Cannot find native binding"). Sequential runs never overlap, so the failure
 * is concurrency-only.
 *
 * The fix reads the embedded bytes (a plain content read, never a dlopen, so it
 * cannot race) and writes them ONCE to a content-keyed file under the
 * machine-global base dir, via a tmp-file + atomic rename, then hands the loader
 * that real path. Plain `require()` of a real on-disk `.node` is an ordinary
 * `dlopen` of a stable, read-only file — many processes can map it at once, as
 * with any shared library. The cache is keyed by content hash so a new binary's
 * addon lands in a fresh file and the prior one stays valid; it is never
 * deleted, so there is no cleanup to race on and no per-invocation extraction
 * cost (the hot path for per-event hooks is a single stat).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this module must import only node builtins. It runs before the
 * store's Turso loader evaluates (it is what sets the env var that loader
 * reads), so importing anything that transitively pulls in
 * `@tursodatabase/database` — e.g. the `@claude-prove/store` barrel — would
 * evaluate that loader too early and defeat the fix. The base-dir resolution is
 * therefore inlined rather than imported from `registryBaseDir`.
